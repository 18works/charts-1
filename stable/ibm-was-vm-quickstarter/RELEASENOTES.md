  - Refer to [Prerequisities of WAS Quickstarter](http://ibm.biz/WASQuickstarterPrerequisites)

# Known Issues
  - As the resources used by WAS VM Quickstarter virtual machines reach the capacity specified in the Helm chart, the service will automatically indicate to users trying to create a new service that there is not enough resources to complete their request.   While the service instance is created, it is placed in `PENDING` state.  When more capacity is added to the target vCenter Datacenter or other services instances have been cancelled making more capacity available, the service instances are left in `PENDING` state.  These service instances can be safely deleted and the user can reattempt creating a new service instance.
